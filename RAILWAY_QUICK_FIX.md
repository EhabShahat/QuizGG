# ðŸš¨ Quick Fix for Railway Deployment

## The Problem
Your deployment is failing due to Windows line endings (`\r`) in shell scripts.

## âœ… Solution Applied
I've created a Python-based startup script that avoids shell script issues entirely.

## ðŸ”§ What to Do Now

### Option 1: Use the New Python Startup (Recommended)
1. Go to your **api** service in Railway dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Deploy**
3. Change the **Start Command** to: `python railway-start.py`
4. Click **Deploy**

### Option 2: Override the Start Command
1. Go to your **api** service in Railway dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Deploy**
3. Set **Start Command** to: `gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker -c gunicorn_conf.py classquiz:app`
4. Click **Deploy**

### Option 3: Fix Line Endings (Advanced)
If you want to keep using shell scripts:
1. Convert all `.sh` files to Unix line endings
2. Use a tool like `dos2unix` or VS Code to convert line endings

## ðŸŽ¯ Environment Variables Still Needed

Don't forget to set these environment variables in your **api** service:

```env
SECRET_KEY=D683E3EA550160F6DCC84FE5CE5E13D82C0DAEDC610A7C4360C1266C426B728C
DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
REDIS=${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}
ROOT_ADDRESS=https://your-frontend-domain.up.railway.app
MAX_WORKERS=1
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
MEILISEARCH_URL=http://localhost:7700
SKIP_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=True
STORAGE_BACKEND=local
STORAGE_PATH=/app/data
```

## ðŸš€ After Fixing

1. **API service** should start successfully
2. Set up **Worker service** with same environment variables
3. Set up **Frontend service** with frontend-specific variables
4. Generate public domain for frontend
5. Update `ROOT_ADDRESS` in API and Worker services

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Checklist

- [ ] Fix API service start command
- [ ] Set API environment variables
- [ ] Fix Worker service (same as API)
- [ ] Set Frontend environment variables
- [ ] Generate frontend domain
- [ ] Update ROOT_ADDRESS
- [ ] Test the application

The Python startup script I created will handle database migrations and start the server properly without shell script issues!
